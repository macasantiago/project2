                <strong>1999</strong>
                <br />
                Bianca Stratford is incredibly eager to go out with their school's hottie, Joey Donner. Rather than go
                out with a boy, Kat Stratford would sooner die. Bianca is allowed to date Mr. Stratford's ruleâ€”that is,
                when Kat does. Bianca pleads with her sister to spend the evening in "teenage normalcy." Bianca has no
                idea that Cameron, her adorable but controversial French tutor, is also attempting to set her sister up,
                in addition to Joey. Patrick, the "set up guy" for Joey and Camereon, is attempting to persuade Kat to
                go out with him. Will Kat go out with him, though, and will it work? Will Joey and Bianca go out?

                Hugh Grant is a modest bookseller whose life is irrevocably altered when the world's most well-known
                movie star enters his store and gives him a big, wet kiss. "I'm not having fun at the expense of my
                life, I'm having fun at the expense of 'her' life," actress Roberts, who plays a notorious movie star
                who earns about $15 million a picture and must put up with irate fans, internet invasions of privacy,
                and tabloid scandals, declares.

                <strong><i>He Is Just Not That Into You</i></strong>
                <br />
                <strong>2009</strong>
                <br />
                Trying to read the signs of the other sex and hoping to be the exceptions to the "no-exceptions" rule, a
                group of interconnected twenty- and thirty-somethings from Baltimore navigate their various
                relationships from the shallow end of the dating pool through the deep, murky waters of married life.
                Alex suggests that Gigi should stop staring at her phone; all she wants is a man who says he'll call and
                actually does. After years of dedicated singlehood, Beth questions whether she should break up with her
                boyfriend, Neil, but he doesn't see anything wrong with their single status. Because Ben struggles to
                trust himself around Anna, Janine is unsure if she can trust her husband. Anna is torn between her
                straight-talking, no-fuss standby, Conor, who is upset that he can't have her, and the attractive
                married man. Mary just needs to find a straight man to join her vast network of adoring, encouraging
                men. He (or she) is just not that into you, if you've ever sat by the phone wondering why he promised to
                call but didn't, or if you're having trouble understanding why she no longer wants to sleep with you, or
                why your relationship isn't progressing to the next level.
